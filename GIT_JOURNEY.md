## 1. Project Overview
This challenge simulated a real-world DevOps environment where I had to resolve complex merge conflicts across multiple branches (`main`, `dev`, and `conflict-simulator`).

## 2. Command Library
Here are the essential Git commands I mastered during this project:

### Repository Setup
- `git clone`: Cloned the template repository.
- `git remote add instructor`: Linked the template as an upstream source.
- `git remote add origin`: Linked my personal GitHub repository.

### Branch Management
- `git branch`: Listed local branches.
- `git checkout -b [name]`: Created and switched to new branches.
- `git merge [branch]`: Combined changes and handled conflicts.

### Conflict Resolution
- `git status`: Identified files with conflict markers.
- `git add [file]`: Staged files after manual resolution.
- `git commit -m "[message]"`: Finalized the merge history.

### Advanced Mastery Tools
- `git stash`: Safely paused work without committing.
- `git fetch`: Synchronized metadata from remotes.
- `git cherry-pick`: Attempted to grab specific commits.
- `git rebase`: Learned how to rewrite branch history.
- `git reset --hard`: Mastered the ability to "undo" mistakes and sync with remotes.
- `git tag`: Labeled the final release with `v1.0`.

## 3. Conflict Resolution Strategies
- **Phase 2 (Dev Merge)**: Prioritized production stability while integrating developer features as optional settings.
- **Phase 3 (Simulator Merge)**: Implemented an "Experimental Mode" strategy, keeping cutting-edge AI features behind flags to maintain backward compatibility.

## 4. Reflection
I have successfully navigated through 12 major file conflicts, synchronized multiple remotes, and demonstrated advanced version control workflows. This repository now represents a clean, fully documented DevOps configuration.
